## example of checking speed of cloudflare ips
1. i use this tool [CloudflareSpeedTest](https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest), download it for your OS. 
2. copy ips that you downloaded in csv file in ip.txt file in Cloudflarespeedtest folder
3. open terminal and run ./CloudflareST.exe if you are using windows. for more info on how to use it read its document.

## Creating CFW subscription backend (IP_API)

1. for more detail about the CFW-BOT go [HERE](https://github.com/2ri4eUI/CFW-BOT)
2. create a text file in any web service you know that can provide you a public link. for purpose of this tutorial i use github.
3. create a .txt file with your desired name
4. use this format for adding ip
```bash
ip:port#name of your config
```
each ip should be in seperate line, you can use `ips.txt` file in this repo as guide
if you dont provide any port it will use 443 as default port

6. save file and get the raw link of your .txt file, just click on RAW on top of the file and copy its link from browser.
5. go to bot and select subscription ips button

9. DONEðŸŽ‰. from now on, every user that you create will have your NEW and UNIQUE backend in their subcription link.

## Changing Ips in users Subscriptions

To fetch updates in the IP_API backend on your sub link, simply update your subscription in your desired app (all app e.g:v2rayng or any other app you are using have this option). The changes typically reflect in the subscription link within 3-5 minutes.
